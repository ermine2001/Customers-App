## Customers-App

*A **window application** written in **Java** with a graphical user interface, created using the **Swing** library*.

It is used to perform operations on a customer database, where each customer has attributes such as: 
* first name 
* last name 
* status 
* VAT
* point count (ilość_pkt) 
* address 
* creation date.

Basic functionalities include:
* adding a new customer 
* displaying a list of customers 
* deleting a customer by last name 
* searching by last name 
* sorting by point count in descending order 
* editing customer data - the methods have already been written - adding their handling to the interface is required.
* customer division into groups - to be expanded in the future

Customer data is stored in RAM memory.
